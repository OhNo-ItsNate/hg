Welcome to The Howling Goatmen website.

This three-page website is meant to provide all that anyone needs to know about the band The Howling Goatmen. There is a landing page which directs to music and biography pages. 

The music page has two songs which users can play, pause, restart from the begginning, and stop. The recordings are a bit rough, but highlight what one could expect to hear live or in a finished recording.

The biography page will contain the biography, once written. For now, it contains placeholder text. It also has a gallery which users can click on thumbnails to view larger versions of the images.
